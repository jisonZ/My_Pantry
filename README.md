# My_Pantry

“Pantry” helps you record food items you have purchased, as well as keep track of the expiration period for every single food item you have! You can either provide an explicit expiration date or allow “Pantry“ to automatically set an expiration date based on the type of food. When you are ready to remove a food item from your fridge, tell “Pantry”! And “Pantry” will remove that item from your list of food. When you need to be reminded of what you have or what is expiring, ask “Pantry”! “Pantry” will give you exactly the reminder you need.

For adding food to your pantry, you could say:

“add pineapple to my pantry.”
“I got pizza on February 24th.”
“I bought beef and potato today."
“Tomato expires tomorrow"

For remove food in your pantry, you could say:

“Remove pineapple and apple.”
“I ate beef and potato.”
“I cooked tomato.”

To see the expiring items in your pantry, you could say:

“what's in my pantry.”
“open my pantry.”
“see pantry.”

To see a specific expiring item in your pantry, you could say:

“Pineapple.”
“When will my pineapple expire?”

Remember that we couldn't keep track of every type of food in the world! Please help us to improve our interactive database by providing a reasonable preservation duration for your special food when Alexa ask you to do so! People in the world who have the same taste as you would love it!
